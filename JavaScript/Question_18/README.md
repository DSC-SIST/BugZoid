Question:
Flashsort is a distribution sorting algorithm showing linear computational complexity O(n) for uniformly distributed data sets and relatively little additional memory requirement. The original work was published in 1998 by Karl-Dietrich Neubert.
The basic idea behind flashsort is that in a data set with a known distribution, it is easy to immediately estimate where an element should be placed after sorting when the range of the set is known.

Difficulty Level : Hard 

Output:
Original Array Elements
[3,0,2,5,-1,4,1]
Sorted Array Elements
[-1,0,1,2,3,4,5]
